Level 1 Task 11 -Capstone Project II: Arrays, functions and string handling


# Capstone 2 Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a JavaScript file called cypher.js.

● Your cypher is going to use the 15th letter after the letter you want to use.
For example, ‘a’ will be ‘p’. Bear in mind that the letters are treated as
cyclical. That means that ‘p’ will be coded to ‘e’ (the 10th letter after ‘p’ is ‘z’,
so 5 letters after that will be ‘e’ because the cycle starts again).

● Create a function that will encode any message you give it.

● Print out the encoded message.

● A few things to note:

o You may not simply create an array of the alphabet!

o You may need to do some research on how to turn a letter into a number.

o Be aware of what happens with capital versus lower case letters.
You need to account for this.

o Spaces and punctuation marks need to stay the same when
encoded. So a space will remain a space, a full stop will remain a
full stop, etc.
